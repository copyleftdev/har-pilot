I want to create a Rust CLI tool that parses HAR files, replays the HTTP interactions, and logs the interactions to the console using fancy emojis. Each call needs to take request headers into account. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the requirements:
1. Parse HAR files to extract HTTP requests and responses.
2. Replay the HTTP requests extracted from the HAR file.
3. Log the interactions to the console using emojis to represent different statuses and actions.
4. Ensure that each HTTP request includes the correct request headers as specified in the HAR file.

Please provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement this tool, including code examples and explanations where necessary.
